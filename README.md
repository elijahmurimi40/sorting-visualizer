# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a Web Visualization tool for sorting algorithms.

I created a sorting algorithm visualizer to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. The project allowed me to deepen my grasp of complex algorithms, improve programming skills, and offer an interactive learning tool for others. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it

Dive into the world of sorting algorithms through this interactive visualizer. [https://sv.elijahmurimi.dev](https://sv.elijahmurimi.dev)
